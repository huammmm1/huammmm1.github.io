I'm currently a Ph.D student at Ajou University, South Korea. My research as a graduate student has been focused on analyzing and finding vulnerabilities of embedded device firmware. And I'm also interested in linux kernel, embedded system, reverse engineering, binary code anaylsis. I face the moment of frustration in many times when I'm trying to understand how things work, and I'm not such a fast learner, but I like to study and read materials such as technical reports, academic papers, books and tutorials, whatever that could help me better understand this field of my interest. Previously I received my B.S from Ajou University in 2015.
